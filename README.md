<h1>Neru Notes</h1>

Neru Notes is a full stack project built with the PERN stack.

This application is being developed to help track your child's sleep patterns. Each day, users will record sleep habits using multiple metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of sleep behaviors. Ultimately, after sufficient tracking, users will gain insights into sleep patterns and strategies for any necessary adjustments. The goal is to facilitate improved sleep for both parents and their children.
